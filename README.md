# assessing-perceived-walkability

## Introduction
Improving walkability contributes to the sustainability of cities. Existing data and methods in walkability assessments and mapping have notable weaknesses associated with the modeled perspective of the walker. View-scape analysis considers more physical factors, such as visible terrain and distance, which can significantly influence pedestrian walking experiences and behaviors. Despite substantial efforts in visual quality and natural resource management, limited attention has been given to
the application of viewscape analysis tools in mapping high-resolution visual walkability on a city-wide scale. This paper presents a viewscape approach for assessing perceived visual walkability using a case study of greenways in Detroit. By creating a high-resolution walkability map, it reveals areas that could be enhanced to improve the overall walking experience. The results of this study can guide urban planning and design, emphasizing the significance of internal connectivity within greenways for creating walkable streets.
